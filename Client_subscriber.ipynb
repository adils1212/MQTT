    "* This project script will create an IoT simulation which will use MQTT protocol to simulate an IoT network in a home automation system. The simulation will leverage a dataset that provides actual data from sensors in a home automation system such as temperature, humidity, light on/off, etc. Data from the dataset will be read, published to a broker, and recieved by a smartphone application that is subscribed to the proper topic. In addition, commands for certain controllers can be sent from the smartphone application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is one of the two modules for the project. The other being Client_publisher. This module will read the published messages from Client_publisher. A smartphone application will be subscribed to the respective topic on the server, recieve the sensor data, and print it. Also, controllers subscribed to the respective topic will receive commands sent from the mobile_devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A GUI will be leveraged to display the sensor data / actuator commands"
